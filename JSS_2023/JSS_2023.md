| EC1 | The study is clearly irrelevant to our research questions, i.e., it is not primarily related to source code comprehension, readability, legibility, or hard-to-understand code, or does not involve any comparison of different ways of writing code. | 
| EC2 | The study is not a full paper (e.g., PhD theses or 4-page papers) or is not written in English: not considering these types of documents in systematic reviews is a common practice.                                                                  |
| EC3 | The study is about legibility, readability, or understandability metrics.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| EC4 | The study is about program comprehension aids, such as visualizations or other forms of analysis or sensory aids, e.g., trace-based execution and code summarization.                                                                                 | 
| EC5 | The study focuses on accessibility, e.g., targets individuals with visual impairments or neurodiverse developers.                                                                                                                                     |

| IC1  (Scope)      | The study must be primarily related to legibility.                                                                                                  |
| IC2 (Methodology) | The study must be or contain a controlled experiment, quasi-experiment, or survey _involving human subjects_.                                       |
| IC3 (Comparison)  | The study must directly compare alternative formatting elements _in terms of code legibility_ and the alternatives must be clearly identifiable.    |
| IC4 (Granularity) | The study must target fine-grained program elements and low-level/limited-scope programming activities. Not design or comments, but implementation. |
